# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting a users needs and then implementing them into a program starts with understanding who the users are, what challenges they may face and what goals they wish to acheive with the project. By creating user stories, it helps with describing the features and functionalitites from the users perspective. User stories can also help developement teams focus on delivering value and that each feature directly addresses a specific need of the user. 


**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
When developing a program an agile approach emphasizes iterative developement. Where the product is built incrementally from the start of the project, rather than trying to deliver it all at once or near the end. Some of the agile processes to incorporate include. Sprint planning which outlines work to be performed during the sprint. Daily stand ups to coordinate activities and share challenges among the team. Sprint reviews to present the completed work to stakeholders and to gather feedback. Retrospectives so we can reflect on the past sprint and make continuous improvements. Lastly, is backlog refinement this helps keep the backlog relevant and populated with user stories that reflect current user needs. 


**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development requires communication, this involves sharing ideas clearly and listning to feedback constructivesly. Effective collaboration is important, as you'll frequently need to work productively with colleagues across various roles within software development, which is a common requirement in the industry. Commitment also comes to mind so taking ownership of tasks and seeing them through to completion. Being flexible in any given situation, being willing to learn and apply new methods. And lastly respect, valuing the contributions of all team members and supporting a positive work environment. Overall, I see these five traits as something every good team member should have in the software development field.
